# Eat-Burger
Eat-Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.


## Introduction:
As part of a coding bootcamp I created a full-stack site that utilizes express, handlebars and mysql. The site takes in user input with the name of a burger and its ingredients. This is stored in the mysql database and the page is refreshed to display the burger along with the button to 'eat' the burger. When eat is clicked the burger is moved from the menu to the plate.
